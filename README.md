## Abstract

_This project is definitely not Rotten Tomatoes._

Have you been searching for a movie review website that can do it all? Look no further than Rancid Tomatillos! The homepage welcomes users to scroll through an extensive list of movies, populated thanks to a network request to a movie data API. At a glance, each movie on the homepage features that movie's poster, a tomatillo rating, and year of release. When a user clicks on a specific movie card, they are brought to a more indepth view of that movie's details. The modal that pops up provides a user with that movie's trailer (or still image if no trailer is available), the full runtime, release year, description, rating, and genre(s) of said movie. If a user knows a specific movie they want to search for, they can type their query into the search bar provided. If no movie can be found with that title, the user is kindly asked to search for another title. Thanks to React Router implementation, a user can easily navigate the site and obtain urls specific to the page they are on.
