## See the Site in Action!

The user is welcomed to an aesthetically pleasing landing page, where they're given a short description about how we hope our application will help get them "unblocked" in their creativity. To proceed into the main portion of the application, we invite the user to click the "Be Inspired" button.

The next page a user navigates to is our "Inspiration Creation" page. A pre-made trio of inspiration (one photo, one word, one color with hexcode) will be waiting for a user upon landing on this page. We have provided a few instructions
on how to use this tool- just click the "?" in the upper right hand corner to get the full instructions.

Here is a quick demo of the saving, reinspiring, and locking abilities of this page:

## Future Goals

- Ability to upload images of finished art

## Stretch Goals

This project allowed us to pick our own learning goals. As a group, we decided to teach ourselves TypeScript, while continuing to solidfy our understandings with React, React Router, and styling with JSX, and CSS.
See below for ways we stretched ourselves even further on this project:

- TypeScript ✅
- React Modal ✅
- Building out our own API using Express ✅
- Hosting our API and App ✅
