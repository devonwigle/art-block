## Stretch Goals

This project allowed us to pick our own learning goals. As a group, we decided to teach ourselves TypeScript, while continuing to solidfy our understandings with React, React Router, and styling with JSX, and CSS.
See below for ways we stretched ourselves even further on this project:

- TypeScript ✅
- React Modal ✅
- Building out our own API using Express ✅
- Hosting our API and App ✅
